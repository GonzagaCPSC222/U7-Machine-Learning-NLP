    "* Find the \"closest\" instance $j$ to $i$ on the $n - 1$ attributes\n",

    "## k Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "Find the k nearest neighbors ...\n",
    "* Usually find the k closest neighbors (instead of just closest)\n",
    "* Then pick classification from among the top k\n",
    "\n",
    "What are good values for the number of neighbors k?\n",
    "* Often done experimentally (with a test set)\n",
    "* Start with k = 1, determine \"error rate\" (more later)\n",
    "* Repeat incrementing k\n",
    "* Pick k with smallest (minimum) error rate\n",
    "     * Often, larger the data (training) set, the larger the k\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets say we found the k nearest neighbors for an instance ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What are ways we could pick the class?\n",
    "* Most frequent occurring class\n",
    "* Weighted \"average\" (based on the relative closest of the k)\n",

    "Note: can use k-NN for regression if, e.g., return the mean of the label values\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distance Functions\n",
    "k-NN works by calculating distances between instances\n",
    "* Many possible ways to do this ... generalized through \"distance measures\"\n",

    "    * Triangle equality\n",
    "    * \"Shortest distance between any two points is a straight line\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean Distance is most often used: Given an instance, treat it as a \"vector\" in n space\n",
    "* Use Pythagoras' Theorem to find distance between them\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "* Given two points (i.e., rows) with $n = 2$: $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$\n",
    "* The length (i.e., distance) of the straight line joining the points is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^{2} + (y_1 - y_2)^{2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Euclidean $n$-space\n",

    "$$\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(a_i - b_i)^{2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Other examples are described in the book (e.g., Manhattan \"city block\" distance)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Do you see any possible issues with Euclidean distance?\n",
    "* Larger values tend to dominate smaller ones\n",
    "* Can degrade into a few attributes driving the distances\n",
    "    * e.g., [Mileage=18,457, Doors=2, Age=12]\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Normalization\n",
    "One solution is to scale all values between 0 and 1 (\"min-max\" normalization)\n",
    "* Use the formula: `(x - min(xs)) / ((max(xs) - min(xs)) * 1.0)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How can we deal with categorical values?\n",
    "* $dist(v_1, v_2) = 0$ if values $v_1 = v_2$\n",
    "    * Same values\n",
    "* For nominal values, $dist(v_1, v_2) = 1$ if $v_1 \\neq v_2$\n",
    "    * Different values\n",
    "* For ordinal values, assign to 1 or use the \"distance\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What do we do about missing values?\n",
    "* Don't have missing values\n",
    "    * Clean the data first\n",
    "* Be conservative\n",
    "    * Assuming normalized\n",
    "    * If only one value missing:\n",
    "        * Assume the maximum possible distance\n",
    "        * If nominal use the maximum distance (i.e., 1)\n",
    "        * If ordinal use either 1 or furthest distance from known value\n",
    "    * otherwise, if both values missing, use the maximum distance (e.g., 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Distance-based metrics imply equal weighting of attributes\n",
    "* Sometimes can perform better with attribute weights (i.e., some attributes worth more)\n",
    "* \"Feature reduction\" (not using certain attributes) can also help with redundant or \"noisy\" attributes"
