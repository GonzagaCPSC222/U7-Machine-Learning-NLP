    "## Issues in Data Science\n",
    "While we have covered several ethical concerns in this class throughout the data assignments, there are several issues we have not covered yet (some that aren't related to ethics at all). Consider the following:\n",
    "* There is always going to be a new data science tool, library, or programming language to learn\n",
    "    * A career in data science means a career of lifelong learning\n",
    "    * Stay relevant, but don't jump on fads too early. Wait until a new piece of tech gets first party support (e.g. big companies use it, it becomes an industry standard, etc.) before investing too much time learning it\n",
    "* More data does not always mean better results\n",
    "    * Lots of data creates \"Data Paralysis\" (like analysis paralysis)\n",
    "     * Consider what part (AKA data silo) of the big picture your data represents\n",
    "    * Data gets old fast... the time it takes to clean data may make your analysis out of date by the time you get to it\n",
    "* **Always be cognizant of when the data you are analyzing comes from people**\n",
    "    * People are complex and cannot be reduced to a data trail\n",
    "    * There are risks inherently associated with collecting and storing user data\n",
    "        * Sometimes there are non obvious features (or combinations of features) that are PII (personally identifiable information)\n",

    "## Types of Bias Data Scientist Should be Aware of\n",
    "\n",
    "\"It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.\"\n",
    "-Sherlock Holmes (Arthur Conan Doyle)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following text is taken from [CMotions 5 Types of Bias in Data and Analytics](https://cmotions.nl/en/5-typen-bias-data-analytics/)\n",
    "\n",
    ">The chief cause of making the wrong decisions is what we call ‘bias’. Bias is taken to mean interference in the outcomes of research by predetermined ideas, prejudice or influence in a certain direction. Data can be biased but so can the people who analyse the data. When data is biased, we mean that the sample is not representative of the entire population. For example, drawing conclusions for the entire population of the Netherlands based on research into 10 students (the sample). When people who analyse data are biased, this means they want the outcomes of their analysis to go in a certain direction in advance."

When a model \"underfits\" the training data, it is said to have **high bias** (think of a really short decision tree that fails to capture the complexity of what it is suppose to model).\n",
